# React Query Exercise with TanStack Query v4

This project is a React.js application built to practice using the features of TanStack Query v4. It leverages React Query for data fetching, loading state management, and error handling.

## Features

- **React Query v4**: The project utilizes React Query v4, a library for managing remote data fetching, caching, and synchronization in React applications. It provides an intuitive API to handle loading states, error handling, and data synchronization.
- **Efficient Data Fetching**: The application uses React Query's features to fetch data from remote APIs and seamlessly handle loading states. It provides a smooth user experience by displaying loading indicators and efficiently updating data.
- **Error Handling**: React Query v4 simplifies error handling during data fetching. It allows you to gracefully display error messages to users and provide fallback UIs when encountering errors.

## Project Focus

This project focuses on fetching data, handling loading states, and managing errors using React Query's powerful features. With React Query v4, you can easily handle loading states with the `isLoading` property. Here's an example of how to handle loading states:

## ABOUT ME 
I am delighted that you have taken an interest in my project. At 26 years old, I hold a degree in mechanical engineering. Following graduation, I spent approximately five months working as an engineer in a specific field. However, during this time, I realized that the role did not align with my aspirations and overall satisfaction.

Driven by my passion for coding, software, and computer components, I extensively researched various career options, ultimately gravitating towards web development. The more I delved into this field, the stronger my interest grew. I became determined to excel as a talented frontend web developer. Notably, my engineering background has equipped me with highly organized and systematic work habits, facilitating effective learning and contributing significantly to my educational journey.

I hope this brief introduction has provided you with insight into my background and motivations without becoming overly tedious.
